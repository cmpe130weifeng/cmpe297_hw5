The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to use Lightly LabelStudio AL. Label Stuido AI is an open source data labeling tool for labeling data and exploring new data. You can perform different types of labeling with many data formats. Lightly is used for continuous learning. Therefore, Light LabelStudio AI combines continuous learning and active learning. I followed steps from https://github.com/lightly-ai/Lightly_LabelStudio_AL. </br>
These steps are: </br>
</t>  1. Installation and Requirements </br>
  2. Download the images </br>
  3. Analyze and subsample the dataset </br>
  4. Label a subset of images to train a classifier </br>
  5. Train a model and do active learning
</br>
